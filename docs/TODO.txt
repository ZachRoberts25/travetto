In-Progress
==============

? Tests
  ? Better unit tests

On Deck
==============
? Cyclically dependencies, errors
? Faker, numbers with precision
? 

? Elasticsearch Support
  ? Extended query language
  ? 

? Lambda for REST
  - Move to JWT as session store, prep for Lambda
  X Entire rest app as an AWS lambda
  X Individual routes as individual lambdas
  X API Gateway configuration
  ? Auto deployment of application
  X CLI entry point to facilitate

? SQL - as a doc store, limited functionality
  ? Model support for SQL databases
  ? Might need to be a whole new set of sql operations
  X Using Sequelize?
  X Already supports most of the needed features, might be an easy win
